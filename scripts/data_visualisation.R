# Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For
# example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot. An
# alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot, where the shape (of the density
# of points) is drawn. Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see
# geom_violin().

# In many types of data, it is important to consider the scale of the
# observations. For example, it may be worth changing the scale of the axis to
# better distribute the observations in the space of the plot. Changing the
# scale of the axes is done similarly to adding/modifying other components
# (i.e., by incrementally adding commands). Try making these modifications:
# Represent weight on the log10 scale; see scale_y_log10().

# So far, weâ€™ve looked at the distribution of weight within species. Try making

# jitter layer to show actual measurements. Add color to the data points on your
# boxplot according to the plot from which the sample was taken (plot_id).
